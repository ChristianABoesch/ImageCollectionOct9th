Here's a webpage consisting of photograph-style AI images featuring jars of jelly.

Questions:
1. How can I make sure the music doesn't start playing over itself if I click the "play" button without having clicked the "stop" button?
2. How do I add a "pause" feature that allows the song to keep playing right from when it was stopped?
